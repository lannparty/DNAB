Behavior Contract Tests - Language-Agnostic UI Component Contracts

These tests define the expected behavior of UI components and can be run against:
1. Python (current implementation with cv2)
2. Rust WebRTC server (future implementation)
3. Any other implementation

Tests are independent of implementation details and focus on observable behavior.
